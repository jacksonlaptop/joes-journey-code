They never wait, pause or block: no Next, no pointer events, about 3s, they keep clear of the transport, the hint pill and the props, a pause holds them, Prev / Next clears them, and no line or scene timing changes. The bubble look (parchment, themed, a tail that joins without a seam) now lives here and Storytime 2 shares it; ' + 's117 · the village fire no longer glitches halfway through Trogdor\u2019s flame: as the roofs caught (\u2018many names\u2019, \u2018put fear\u2019) each new stage\u2019s flames came up under the old cool night grade and showed as dark / green ghost flames while the whole frame changed colour; now each stage\u2019s warmer grade leads (1.6s) and its flames follow .6s later (1.1s), crossing with the last stage\u2019s, so the fire simply spreads; the fairies\u2019 ending is planned from the Replay CTA and My Story\u2019s music (the site\u2019s ambient) waits until they are silent — no overlap; a lift or skip before then ends them with a quick 1.2s fade; ' + 's116 · the village camera makes two moves in all (a slow drift across the houses to Trogdor as his flame starts, a slow push on \u2018Trogdor!\u2019); \u2018Trogdor! Trogdor The Burninator...\u2019 holds 1.5s longer on the banner over the black before the tavern (Joe: the one timing change; everything after is 1.5s later); the mountain theme is audible from the first seconds in the cave and rises gently, carries on into the forest and stops at the end of its phrase as Joe dismounts; the fairies start on the aura, a little louder, stay up through the portal and the pull and come up louder still as Joe floats through the vortex, then end on their phrase; every sound effect 20% quieter (SFX_TRIM); the loader\u2019s line is Joe\u2019s cleaned-up \u2018that was something\u2019; ' + 's115 · the forest music is Joe\u2019s fairies track: it comes in very slowly (~9s from silence) as the mountain theme fades, loops gaplessly on its 16-bar cycle (on the story clock) through the aura, the walk-up, the inspect and the tap wait, sinks to ~28% under the portal and the vortex through the pull and the tunnel, and at the end finishes on a musical boundary (the end of its phrase, or of its cycle if that is near) instead of stopping; leaving early ends it at the next bar line; the portal\u2019s turn-on is Joe\u2019s new sound: its build starts with the orb tap and its big hit lands on the portal\u2019s gem and runes lighting (held to the clip\u2019s clock), the vortex coming in under its decay; the music ducks a little less under Jim\u2019s narration (now at 60%); no line or scene timing and nothing visual changed; ' + 's114 · music: one track from the cave to the forest (the mountain fantasy theme, from the start of the tale on its clock): a quiet bed under the cave, the village and the tavern, rising slowly, low under the \u2018Joe the Righteous\u2019 cheer, then up for the ride over the hills and mountains, and a slow 3s fade as the forest arrives (the battle and hills tracks are unwired); the forest music now plays on through the orb\u2019s tap wait and stays in, well under the vortex, until the black on \u2018now...\u2019; the music ducks under every prominent sound by that sound\u2019s own loudness (quick down, smooth back up, only while it is loud; the long beds take a small fixed dip), the ta-da included; every flash of light has a flash sound on its peak (the orb tap\u2019s gold bloom, the portal\u2019s pull flash, its closing flare, the hand-over into the tunnel, the Replay press); jumps from Joe\u2019s run: the village Trogdor\u2019s landing no longer kicks at the end of his swoop (its last leg started at full speed), the three chickens start their startle from their last idle frame (the seek landed on the clip\u2019s own blend into the hop), and the tavern-window Trogdor fades in only once his clip is running (a slow start showed him frozen, then leaping ahead); no line or scene timing changed; ' + 's113 · sound: Joe\u2019s music is in (music group): the battle theme from the cave to the end of the tavern, very quiet in the cave, a little up for the village, a small dip for the \u2018Trogdor! Trogdor\u2019 black, full in the tavern, on the story\u2019s own clock so its last hit lands on \u2018Joe the Righteous\u2019 and it ends by itself; the hills theme from \u2018Joe the Righteous\u2019 over the ride, out as the forest arrives; the forest theme from the forest until the orb wakes (\u2018shake and glow\u2019); Prev / Next, ?scene= and a replay put each track where the story is; stand-in effects (sfx group): the orb\u2019s shimmer, its whoosh up, the portal switching on, the vortex bed (from the portal opening, a murmur once it shuts, up again with the tunnel, soft under Replay, out under the loader) and the orb\u2019s thud on the path; the ta-da\u2019s held chord (the ringing as Trogdor reached the window) is eased out after its hit; the woodland cheer plays again (it waited for the end of the whole line and the hills took over first); pause holds every sound by instance; glitches from Joe\u2019s s112 run: the banner no longer vanishes for a frame in the tavern (it is its own layer now, the village\u2019s effects leaving no longer take it with them); the walk-up really crossfades into the inspect shot (the near forest\u2019s effects started with the crossfade and stalled it ~0.8s into a cut; they now wait for it); the orb\u2019s fall can no longer leave nothing behind (a clip that never starts gets the plain drop, a missing still keeps the orb art, dimmed); the portal\u2019s closing streak is feathered out just past the arch; the pull flash\u2019s ring comes in soft (re-encoded); no line or scene timing changed; ' + 's112 · cavern Trogdor is hovered and pressed only on his own pixels (his whole 1140px video box used to take the pointer), and the castle portal likewise (a precomputed mask of its poster); the story’s own buttons are sentence case (Back to the story, Skip this part, Continue without sound, Turn on the sound!, the line’s ‘- Next’) and keep the themes jj-score gives them; s111 · the village camera is calmer: one move fewer (no creep-in on ‘many names’), every push gentler (the slam 1.36 → 1.24) and slower; Trogdor arrives in the tavern window in a burst of flame and smoke that clears to show him (held on his first frame until then), and the burnt village sits far off low in the window with a warm glow (a 20KB still); the opening forest’s horse no longer drifts in its clip — the drift is baked out of a new dismount clip (ride-dismount2) and the board simply holds its old final slide, so nothing chases anything (the old board lagged and jumped up to 15px a frame); the Replay Storytime button grows from its centre on hover (it grew to the left); s110 · glitch sweep: My Story is no longer drawn underneath the tale (its whole animated page was composited under the story — with the tale’s own layers that came to ~85 screens of GPU layers at 2x, past the tile budget, so tiles dropped and the background blinked through); faded-out Blender plates are not drawn, the code grade steps aside with display:none, two boards are pre-decoded instead of four and figures’ stills are warmed small (composited layers ~550 → ~190, full-screen layers 48 → 23); the aura’s dip and the walk-up dip only lift once the new shot is painted under the black (at 800px the close-up popped in half-lit); the move into the inspect beat is a plain soft crossfade (no gold light before anything magical happens); the village Trogdor is re-keyed from the source (no green rim) and runs forward only — huff, flame at 2.2s, then a seamless forward fire loop (vil-dragon-fire2; the old clip ran the flame backwards); s109 · the tavern fireplace is never empty: the Seedance flame stays until the Blender hearth is actually playing (frames advancing), then they crossfade (the render comes up with its board, the flame fades out over 1.2s); if the render never arrives the flame simply stays; a rig that has gone can no longer hide or un-hide the new shot’s flames (Prev / Next into the tavern showed both, or neither); s108 · fixes after Joe’s s106/s107 run: the ending’s loader is back (the forest’s Blender plates and lights sat over it as a black mist — they now go with the black, with the orb and the hidden scene’s clips); far fewer clips decode at once through the handovers (cave → village 7 → 5, village → tavern 14 → 5: an outgoing shot’s fx hold their frame as they dissolve, the village stops under its black before the tavern builds, a new board’s Blender layers start once its crossfade is through, a fire stage the village has burnt past is let go, the tavern’s Seedance flames never start under the black when the render replaces them); a hidden tab / browser pane pauses the tale and picks it up on return (Chrome stopped the clips on a hidden page while the words and CSS ran on — figures lost or stuck); a clip refused on resume gets a second try; the forest backs up on the frame actually on screen, along a smooth curve (the horse no longer jolts as the board slides); the aura starts as Joe steps off the horse (‘dismount’, ~1.2s sooner) and still ends where it did; the orb stays in the air until the portal’s closing flash, then drops straight down from exactly where it hangs and lies flat and dead on the path (Blender fall + flat still; phones / reduced motion: a plain drop, then the still; nothing changes after); no line or scene timing changed except the aura’s start; s107 · the circle that opens the tale (and the story’s own fades) is now pure black like the loader’s fade and the rest of the site (#05080f read a touch lighter, so the handover jumped); s106 · the Blender fx pass reaches the rest of the tale (blender-fx/<scene>, ?fx=0 = the s105 look): the village gets mist + motes, embers + ash, dark foliage in the corners and its roofs catching fire in three stages — the first ~.5s after his flame, the next on ‘many names’, the full blaze on ‘put fear’ — each stage joining the last on its clock so the fire grows, with a warmer multiply grade per stage kept clear round the moon; the tavern’s hearth is now the Blender fire burning inside the fireplace (the Seedance flame steps aside and stops decoding; hover still swells it), with smoke under the beams, motes and deep warm corners; the hills get valley mist on the board’s own pan, the castle mist, rock lips and his flame’s light on the clip’s clock, the forest boards mist + motes + foliage (the wide board’s set rides its slide and comes in close with the aura); the orb is a real object on the ground: its contact shadow, a moonbeam when it is first seen, the Blender orb turning on its point (woken and glowing on ‘shake and glow’; Safari keeps the lit still), a tap flash, a light burst that resolves the gold into the portal shot, and after the drop it lands, hops and settles on the path; in forest4b its point now sits on the contact shadow the inspect clip paints (it hung above it); the portal’s pull is the Blender flash (streaks spiral in, the bloom peaks on the clip’s own starburst, the s105 flash kept only as a soft wash to the corners) and the hand-over to the tunnel is the Blender bloom; phones get stills (no orb clips, no one-shots), reduced motion gets stills and the s105 CSS blooms; each scene’s fx load a scene ahead and only decode while they show; pause holds all of it; no line or scene timing changed; s105 · the last line is now ‘Well, it is for now...Anyway this is Designer Joe...I heard he’s pretty magical too.’ (the cut to black moves onto ‘now...’, same 3s hold); pause holds everything that moves: the rides over the hills, the mountains and the send-off, Trogdor across the sky and the orb’s flight are CSS glides that used to carry on under a pause (they freeze now and pick up from where they stopped), and the dismount no longer leaps on resume; the tavern fire is pinned to the fireplace on the board (it floated on the wall in portrait), fills the hearth and sits on the logs, with a second flame behind it and a flickering glow inside the hearth; the woodland aura close-up goes in and out through a soft dip to black (the instant 1.75x cut and the zoom-out + walk-up arrival used to show); the portal flashes purple / white as it swallows Joe, and blooms once more as it hands over to the tunnel; the orb breathes a halo while it waits, lifts on hover, pops with sparkles and a soft ring when pressed, and a gold bloom from the orb carries the tale into the portal shot (the walk-up into the inspect beat goes through the same gold light instead of a dip to black); the tap rings are soft light, not lines; the Blender fx wiring is generic (any rig, lights-only ones too; stills, code-drawn grades, per-shot layers, word triggers fx:key / fx:key=0 / fx:key=.6); no line or scene timing changed (the new last line is shorter as written); s104 · glitch pass (no line or scene timing changed): a new shot’s clips dissolve in with its board instead of snapping on over the old one (the village kids stood in the cave, the send-off riders over the tavern, the portal clip over the close board); the next boards and their figures’ stills / posters are mounted invisibly ahead of time so the GPU has them decoded — the handover no longer stalls ~100-350ms and jumps into the crossfade; the night sky is only moved once the old one has faded (the moon used to blink out the frame a scene changed); the aura pose fades out instead of vanishing; the banner’s snow cap settles in; the tunnel’s black lifts only once its first frame is up (it stalled, then jumped in half-faded); Prev / Next: a line’s closing pause can no longer fire after a jump (it restarted the new line, or sent L8’s tap prompt back), rebuilt clips fade in, ‘Luckily’ starts in the tavern and ‘Joe the Righteous’ on the send-off, and Next into ‘Out of his control’ keeps the running portal; s103 · the cavern gets a Blender atmosphere pass (a pilot): four layers rendered in Blender ride the camera rig at their own depths — moonlit mist + drifting dust motes over the floor behind the figures (warm round Trogdor, cool toward the cave mouth), Trogdor’s heat on his box (the hoard’s glow breathing, embers rising off the hoard and his nostrils), a few big soft out-of-focus motes + the odd bit of falling grit in front, and out-of-focus rock lips in the four corners (a still); seamless 4–6s loops of light on black, screen-blended, loaded only once the loader has handed over and faded in as they play; the code’s fire pools stand down under them (the chest’s gold pool stays); ‘darkness’ sinks the mist, not his glow; pause holds them; phones get stills of the mist + heat only, reduced motion gets the stills; no line or scene timing changed; ?fx=0 = the s102 look; s102 · the rest of Part One gets the light pass: the send-off eases in after Joe on ‘set off’ (moonlight grade, mist); the hills and mountains keep their own pan as the camera and get lights only (a halo round the moon, valley mist / a cold glow off the snow, night-shadowed edges, Trogdor’s sky kept clear); the forest to the portal is lights only too (its boards shift with the horse, the aura push, the dip, the orb’s tap prompt): moonlight shafts through the canopy, dappled light on the path, deep blue-green shadow at the edges, the orb’s gold once it wakes on ‘shake and glow’, the portal’s purple on the path while it is open (on the clip’s clock); the ending (black, vortex, Replay) is left as it was; no line or scene timing changed; ?cam=0 = the old shots; s101 · the tavern and the castle get the camera + light pass: the tavern comes up out of the black on the hearth, pushes over to Joe on ‘a brave young man’, eases out and up to the window on ‘stop this evil’ (Trogdor circles past on a plate of his own behind the wall, a little parallax in the window) and drifts back to the full room 3s after the line lands; hearth light across the floor and onto Joe (always burning, quick flicker), lantern + candle glows, smoke under the beams, deep warm shadow on the far side and corners, window kept clear; the castle (Part Two) opens on a low two-shot, closes in on ‘toe to toe’, over to Trogdor on ‘facing fire’, straight back out on ‘Wait a minute’, leans in to his shrink on ‘Ah yes’, over to Joe on ‘different Joe’, one hard push on ‘story of a Designer’ and a creep into the fade; moonlight grade, the portal’s purple on the ground, fire light only while his flame burns (clip clock), a torch in the gate, a gold bloom behind the Designer, ground mist, shadowed rocks; new figures in a shot join the rig mid-move (no restart); no line or scene timing changed; ?cam=0 = the old shots; s100 · the village gets the camera + light pass (the rig is now one config per scene, CAM_RIGS): it opens on the right-hand cottage and drifts across the houses, pushes in on ‘the local villagers’, goes over to Trogdor as his flame starts, creeps in on ‘many names’, back to the locals on ‘put fear’, hard in on ‘Trogdor!’ as the black comes; a cool night grade clear round the moon, warm window glows riding the board, fire light + a glow on the far sky that burn only while his flame does, the sky darkening at the frame’s edges, vignette; no line or scene timing changed; ?cam=0 = the old shots; s99 · the Replay banner draws in to a big button (half size on desktop, wide + raised clear of the chat bubble on phones); s98 · Replay Storytime: a beat after the last line, its banner turns into the CTA while the vortex spins (the words blow away as motes, the scroll lights purple / gold, runes orbit, the title writes itself in with a shimmer; hover spins the runes faster; Enter / Space); it stays over the loader until My Story lifts; pressed: a burst, black, the ending is undone and the tale restarts from line 1 behind the opening iris; reduced motion = a plain fade; s96 · the cavern gets a camera (2.5D push in on Trogdor, over to the chest, back out) and a light pass (vignette, rock shade, fire + gold pools); ?cam=0 = the old shot; s95 · the move into the inspect beat dips to black and back (no more push/crossfade); stepping into ‘Out of his control’ with Next/Previous opens the portal (the clip used to sit on its first frame); Joe stands on the path through the portal scenes; s94 · Trogdor’s fire clip loops as it did (soft restart dropped); s93 · the forest backs up with the horse on the clip’s clock (no stutter, nothing slides), Trogdor’s fire stops and he huffs again (soft restart), push-in + aura pose + motes on ‘woodland aura’, fewer pose changes and re-measured pose heights, one orb still drifting in front of the arch to the end, real grass in front of the portal, slow black from ‘No where’, the fall runs under the whole last line then loader in / banner out together; s92 · Joe after the gallop is the new knight (ten poses, swapped on the words), in front of the portal; the horse stays planted through the dismount (the clip’s back-drift is cancelled on its clock); the tunnel goes to a held black before the loader; s91 · the dismount only travels while the clip gallops (tied to its clock), the transport sits on the Menu’s centre line, motes stream into Joe and he glows on the energy line, the force shudders him and drags him in steps, the tunnel’s black breathes, new last line with a 2s hold; s90 · the fall through the portal plays under a 75% black before the loader; the orb rises slowly and wanders in shot; the dismount clip no longer slides the horse back; chickens wait for Trogdor; the trio stands behind the mushroom; bigger PAUSED hint; My Story gets its own address (#my-story) so Back replays the tale; s89 · from the cut to black the transport, Skip, space and the arrows are gone (the loader is next); s88 · the village breathes before Trogdor lands and its black is short, mountains move on 1s after Joe leaves frame, no background slide at the dismount, the portal wakes on the close board (no cut out), the quake holds to the end of its scene, the lone spirit stands on the ground, NEXT 2px smaller, no NEXT on the last line and its banner leaves at once, forest motes go with the black; s87 · a glowing NEXT fades in after each line, every scene lingers 5s longer, pause holds the slide / progress / late sounds, PAUSED carries the key hints, the horse rides on the path, the spirit trio stands still on the path, one spirit on the banner, mushrooms glow with spores; s86 · a PAUSED card (the medieval face) with a dim over the scene while the visitor has it paused; s85 · the sound prompt’s Continue is the secondary CTA (Turn on the sound is primary); s84 · no companion during the tale (the follow hook stays unregistered); s83 · previous / next always play the new scene (pause no longer carries over); s82 · the chest (every pressable still) lifts and glows under the pointer; s81 · opening the portal with the Special cursor no longer removes it at the next shot (it was marked taken, like a caught prop); s80 · stepping back out of the ending can no longer strand a see-through story over My Story; s79 · Trogdor brighter over the mountains; prod him in the cave → he jolts + Rise and Shine; s78 · pause on ‘rolling hills…’ not ‘nighttime fell’; pause catches clips born under it; a scene reached while paused settles before freezing; s77 · the three spirits + mushroom perch on the banner stone, a crystal on the other side; s76 · village to black on ‘Trogdor! Trogdor’, back with the tavern; stepping while paused stays paused; label font back; s75 · night sky over hills/mountains (big moons, design-system stars), forest mushrooms + glowing shards, spirit + mushroom on the banner, portal ????? in the Special font, sparkles bigger/denser/glowing, transport debounce; s74 · sparkles re-scatter every shot, denser and coloured round the portal; s73 · Trogdor small, grows in/shrinks away; the wide forest board drifts with the horse at the dismount; bars +16px; s72 · glides never skip on a fresh layer (Joe missing on the hills), bars reset on next/previous; s71 · first-scene hints (arrows + themed pill), montage letterbox on ‘set off’ → off at the dismount, forest sparkle, Trogdor crosses the mountain sky, the line reworded; s70 · the ride crosses the frame (hills on ‘nighttime fell’, mountains on ‘treacherous’), the dismount clip into the wide forest board, the close shot is its own board, Joe’s snow cap + flakes, hearth hover + Chicken Run fixes; s69 · Joe’s gallop clip on the ride (hills, mountains, into the forest), stronger pan; s68 · snow over the mountains + on the banner; tree spirits tappable → Forest Friend; s67 · forest spirits (kodama tilt + rattle, in code), Skip CTA retired; s66 · previous / pause / next transport top centre (also arrow keys + space); s65 · Part One ends on the journey: hills, mountains, the forest, the portal takes Joe; the fight is Part Two';

     upright and a narrow desktop window are left alone) a full-screen card sits over the tale: a small phone that turns from upright to sideways, 'Turn your phone
     sideways for Storytime', and one quiet link, 'Skip to My Story'. While it is up the tale is paused exactly as the pause button would pause it (clock, clips, sound;
     nothing under the card can be pressed), and a tale that has not begun does not begin behind it (the loader and the sound prompt come first, as before). Turned
     sideways, the card fades and the tale starts or carries on by itself; turned upright again mid-tale, the card comes back and the tale waits. The orientation is
     never locked (iOS cannot). The card lives outside #jjst, so the pause does not freeze its own little animation. ?rotate=1 treats any window as a phone (upright =
     taller than wide), for testing on a desktop. The portrait layout under the card is untouched. ---- */

  /* ---- s126 · THE STORYBOOK (a prototype, behind ?book=1 only: without the flag none of this runs and nothing changes). Joe's idea, after a classic storybook
     opening: before the tale a leather book lies on a table in a dark, candle-lit room; the camera drifts toward it; the cover opens; three illuminated spreads
     tell a six-line rhyme, one line and one miniature on every page; the pages turn by themselves; and the last miniature is a drawing of the tale's own first
     frame: the camera pushes into it until it sits exactly over the real shot, the ink and parchment melt away, and the tale begins. Part One gets a prologue,
     Storytime 2 a 'previously'. One mechanism, driven by a small table per part (BOOK_P1 here, the sequel's in storytime2.js):
       { pages: [ { text, red: [words in red], pic, band: 1…5, box?, div?, medal?, corners?, move?, print?, mouth?, singed? } x 6 ], first? }
       · text: the page's line (the copy is Joe's: edit it here) · pic: a picture key (BOOK_ART; bookPic draws its stand-in) · band: the strip along the foot
       · box: the colour of the painted box behind the page's illuminated initial (red, blue, green, gold: the pages that open a spread) · div: the flourish under
         the line (acorn, dragon, sunmoon) · medal: a small roundel on the band (chicken, dragon, knight, arch) · corners: two painted vine corners beside the miniature
       · move: { x, y, k, ms }: the picture's own slow move while the spread is up (the map closes in on the village)
       · print: this picture is the tale's first frame, printed (the match) · mouth: a cave mouth and night sky round it
     How it is drawn: every page is ONE bitmap (parchment, lettering, miniature, band, ornaments: a canvas), so a turning leaf is cheap: it is cut into BOOK_N
     strips of that bitmap, hinged one to the next, and only transforms and opacities move.
     Rules it keeps: Space pauses and Left / Right step (R1: the tale's own keys drive it); nothing answers while paused (R2: it lives inside the stage, under
     the pause card, and every timer and animation is the tale's pause-aware kind); a page never flips as a flat card (R3's spirit). ---- */

    /* ---- s131 · st2-26 · THE PAGE PUPPETS. A miniature at rest in the open spread moves a little: its people change pose, a chicken hops, a shadow drifts, the swirl
       turns. Only while its page is AT REST: under the cover, on a turning leaf and on a page arriving or leaving, the picture is its composed self (every sprite in
       pose 'a'), exactly as before. When a spread comes to rest a group is laid over each of its miniatures: a PLATE (that part of the page with the background plate
       alone on it: the same paper, the same multiply, pixel for pixel) and, over it, each sprite's poses as small bitmaps of their own. A sprite is 'multiplied onto
       the page' by being painted on the page's own paper at its place and then cut to its own outline, which is the same picture as multiplying the whole miniature
       (sprites drawn over the plate first) onto the page: the brief's order, without a blend mode over the 3D book. The two wide paintings (the last page of each
       book, which the camera goes into) are not multiplied: their sprites ride in the painting's own window.
       Budget (the audit): nothing here runs on a frame loop or reads layout. Poses change by HARD CUTS (a stepped opacity animation: never a dissolve, R8), each
       sprite on its own clock; moves are transform animations; both are the compositor's, and both stop with the tale's pause (pauseStory pauses every animation in
       the stage). At most a dozen things move in a spread. Every bitmap is made in build(), under the cover. PUPS: the recipes, by picture. ---- */
